This package supports typesetting Generic Universal Role Playing System (GURPS) materials. It provides many convenience commands (e.g. `\gurps`, `\SJGamesOnlinePolicy`) as well as limited NPC building capabilities with a character environment.

The package requires the use of LuaLaTeX as several of the internal calculations are in Lua.
